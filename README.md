Garming Running Summary
Goal for project: Have user enter their garmin CSV running data and their email.  We take the csv data clean and filter it so we can work with it.  Create running summaries day by day,
by weeks and months.  Goign to do this mostly through the use of pandas and some numpy libraries.  Also use matlib to show visual graphs of running trends and progress.
Take all their data then send them the summary in their email with the overall summary and graphs so the user can visually see their running progress.
Hoping to build on this project big time where it can formulate runnning plans, store their data, and be automated in some format
LETS GO
